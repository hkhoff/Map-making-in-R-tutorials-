# Map-making-in-R-tutorials-

#My hope with these tutorials is to help demystify the world of spatial analysis in R. 

These tutorials were originally posted in the Bioinformatics Workshop section of the Kartzinel Lab page (kartzinellab.com) as an extension of a previous tutorial focused on making basic sampling maps in well-known R packages. In an effort to make these tutorials more interactive (and hopefully useful), this page now includes the basic code pipeline for the tutorial and some example data that can be fed directly into the code, as well as the RMarkdown pdf that was originally posted on the lab website.
